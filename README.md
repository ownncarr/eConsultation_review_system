## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
When the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) releases draft legislations for public consultation, stakeholders submit a large number of comments and suggestions.  
Manually reviewing these submissions is time-consuming and risks overlooking valuable feedback.  

The goal is to **develop an AI model and visualization tool** that:
- Performs **Sentiment Analysis** on each stakeholder comment.
- Generates **Summaries** to quickly capture the essence of long comments.
- Produces a **Word Cloud** highlighting commonly used terms and themes.  

This solution aims to reduce manual effort, ensure no comment is missed, and provide structured insights for decision-makers.

- **Interactive Dashboard (MVP)**:
